song title: It's All On U

Lyrics
===========
At first I didn't think that I was
Cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets getting
Swallowed by the sea
Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow
How you bought me home
I guess I'll never know

With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it's gold
And it's all on you

With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it's gold
And it's all on you

(I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you)

Can't see, dark road
Driving up the hills
Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got no where to go
We can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know

I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it's gold
And it's all on you

And it's all on you
And it's all on you
And it's all on you

Kicks from you
I get my kicks from you
===========
